# A comparison between two TTI implementations: Devito and Madagascar

This tutorial attempts to draw a comparison between the low rank finite-difference (FD) from [Song et al., 2013](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/193/2/960/634855), 
which can be reproduced via [Madagascar](http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Main_Page) and an approach proposed by [Zhang et al., 2011](https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/1.3554411) 
implemented throught an explicit FD scheme with [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/)
